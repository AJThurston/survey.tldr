# svy.tldr
## Survey Tools for Limited Descriptive Research

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of svy.tldr is to provide basic, formatted values from complex survey data.  It is basically just a wrapper for the srvyr package.  This package is predominantly for working with factor variables.  

## To-Do
* Actually make IDS, Strata, and Weights optional, use "is.missing" from this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28370249/correct-way-to-specifiy-optional-arguments-in-r-functions  
* Move away from pipes apparently

## Installation

You can install svy.tldr from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AJThurston/svy.tldr")
```

## Dependencies

The following packages and versions are required to use `svy.tldr`:

* survey (4.1-1)
* srvyr (1.1.0)
* tidyverse (1.3.2)

## Arguments

The `svy.tldr` package requires the following arguments:

* df: A survey dataframe consisting of at minimum a survey item formatted as a factor variable.[class = data.frame]
* ids: Survey case ids (optional) [numeric]
* strata: Survey strata (optional) [numeric]
* weights: Survey weights (optional) [numeric]
* svyitem: A survey item with factor (or ordered factor) format [factor]

The following are optional arguments, but the `svygroup` argument is often used:

* svygrp: A survey grouping variable, can be binary or multiple group, in factor format (optional) [factor]

These are other optional arguments that change the output of values:

* fltr_refuse: Filter refusals formatted 'refused' (Default = TRUE) [logical]
* fltr_nas: Filter NAs across dataframe (Default = TRUE) [logical]
* flg_low_n: Flag estimates with less than n = 100 in either svyitem response option or svygroup (or the combination thereof) [logical]

Finally, this is just a simple formatting argument to change the output from long `tidy` format data to wide format as in typical survey toplines or for papers:

* fmttd_tbl: Produces a formatted table with columns for each group and statistic (Default = F; statistics nested w/in group) [logical]

## Example dataframe `svy.tldr.df`

The following example dataframe is the `apistrat` dataset from the `survey` package with some minor modifications to make the output of `svy.tldr` easier to interpret. 

```{r data, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(svy.tldr)
library(srvyr)
library(survey)
library(tidyverse)

data(svy.tldr.df)
```

## Examples

### Example 1 - Basic Use
This example uses the minimum arguments of the `svy.tldr` to produce the means, standard error of the means, and unweighted counts for a factor variable survey response.  Output is a `tidy` style output table with the grouping variable (in this case, only "overall"), the response options for the survey item, and the values mentioned above.

In this example, data from `svy.tldr.df` dataset using the `metgoal` variable which is a binary factor variable for whether or not the person met their goal. 

```{r ex.1}
svy.tldr(df = svy.tldr.df,
         ids = "id",
         strata = "st",
         weights = "wt",
         svyitem = "metgoal")
```

### Example 2 - Use with Groups with `svygrp`
This is the same as the example above, except the output is now grouped by whether or not the case was eligible (Eligible/Ineligible).  Again, the default is a `tidy` style output table, but the grouping variable includes overall, eligible, and ineligible.

```{r ex.2}
svy.tldr(df = svy.tldr.df,
         ids = "id",
         strata = "st",
         weights = "wt",
         svyitem = "metgoal",
         svygrp = "eligib")
```

### Example 3 - Filter Refusals with `fltr_refuse`
The default behavior of `svy.tldr` is to filter refusals, but this function can be turned off if refusals are of value to you.  In this example, there are no refusals.

```{r ex.3}
svy.tldr(df = svy.tldr.df,
         ids = "id",
         strata = "st",
         weights = "wt",
         svyitem = "metgoal",
         svygrp = "eligib",
         fltr_refuse = F)
```

### Example 4 - Filter NA responses or groups with `fltr_nas`
By default, all output data from `svy.tldr` with groups or responses which are `NA` are filtered.  

```{r ex.4}
svy.tldr(df = svy.tldr.df,
         ids = "id",
         strata = "st",
         weights = "wt",
         svyitem = "metgoal",
         svygrp = "eligib",
         fltr_refuse = F,
         fltr_nas = F)
```

### Example 5 - Flag low sample size subgroups with `flg_low_n`
If working with larger datasets, you can flag estimates from smaller (N < 100) sample size subgroups.  The default behavior is to not flag these estimates.  Currently, the size of the flag (i.e., 100) is not adjustable.  This creates a new value where 0 = not flagged, 1 = flagged.

```{r ex.5}
svy.tldr(df = svy.tldr.df,
         ids = "id",
         strata = "st",
         weights = "wt",
         svyitem = "metgoal",
         svygrp = "eligib",
         flg_low_n = T)
```

### Example 6 - Present group results as columns with `fmttd_tbl`
This argument changes the output from tidy format to wide format.

```{r ex.6, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fmttd <- svy.tldr(df = svy.tldr.df,
         ids = "id",
         strata = "st",
         weights = "wt",
         svyitem = "metgoal",
         svygrp = "eligib",
         fmttd_tbl = T)

fmttd %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F)
```
